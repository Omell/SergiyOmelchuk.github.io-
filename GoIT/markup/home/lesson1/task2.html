    English is a
    West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global
    lingua franca.[4][5] It is an official language of almost 60 sovereign states, the most commonly
    spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand,
    and a widely spoken language in countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia.[6] It
    is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish.[7] It is widely
    learned as a second language and is an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union,
    and of many other world and regional international organisations.
    English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English,
    a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth
    century, are called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman
    conquest of England.[8] Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction
    of the printing press to London and the Great Vowel Shift. Through the worldwide influence of
    the British Empire, Modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries.
    Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite
    television, and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower,
    English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many
    regions and in professional contexts such as science.English is a
